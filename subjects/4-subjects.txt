Assignment name  : fprime
Expected files   : fprime.c
Allowed functions: printf, atoi
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes a positive int and displays its prime factors on the
standard output, followed by a newline.

Factors must be displayed in ascending order and separated by '*', so that
the expression in the output gives the right result.

If the number of parameters is not 1, simply display a newline.

The input, when there's one, will be valid.

Examples:

$> ./fprime 225225 | cat -e
3*3*5*5*7*11*13$
$> ./fprime 8333325 | cat -e
3*3*5*5*7*11*13*37$
$> ./fprime 9539 | cat -e
9539$
$> ./fprime 804577 | cat -e
804577$

Assignment name  : ft_split
Expected files   : ft_split.c
Allowed functions: malloc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a function that takes a string, splits it into words, and returns them as
a NULL-terminated array of strings.

A "word" is defined as a part of a string delimited either by spaces/tabs/new
lines, or by the start/end of the string.

Your function must be declared as follows:

char    **ft_split(char *str);

Assignment name  : rev_wstr
Expected files   : rev_wstr.c
Allowed functions: write, malloc, free
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes a string as a parameter, and prints its words in
reverse order.

A "word" is a part of the string bounded by spaces and/or tabs, or the
begin/end of the string.

If the number of parameters is different from 1, the program will display
'\n'.

In the parameters that are going to be tested, there won't be any "additional"
spaces (meaning that there won't be additionnal spaces at the beginning or at
the end of the string, and words will always be separated by exactly one space).

Examples:

$> ./rev_wstr "le temps du mepris precede celui de l'indifference" | cat -e
l'indifference de celui precede mepris du temps le$
$> ./rev_wstr "abcdefghijklm"
abcdefghijklm
$> ./rev_wstr "il contempla le mont" | cat -e
mont le contempla il$
$> ./rev_wstr | cat -e
$
$>

Assignment name  : rostring
Expected files   : rostring.c
Allowed functions: write, malloc, free
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes a string and displays this string after rotating it
one word to the left.

Thus, the first word becomes the last, and others stay in the same order.

A "word" is defined as a part of a string delimited either by spaces/tabs, or
by the start/end of the string.

Words will be separated by only one space in the output.

If there's less than one argument, the program displays \n.

Example:

$>./rostring "abc   " | cat -e
abc$
$>
$>./rostring "Que la      lumiere soit et la lumiere fut"
la lumiere soit et la lumiere fut Que
$>
$>./rostring "     AkjhZ zLKIJz , 23y"
zLKIJz , 23y AkjhZ
$>
$>./rostring | cat -e

Assignment name  : ft_list_foreach
Expected files   : ft_list_foreach.c, ft_list.h
Allowed functions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a function that takes a list and a function pointer, and applies this
function to each element of the list.

It must be declared as follows:

void    ft_list_foreach(t_list *begin_list, void (*f)(void *));

The function pointed to by f will be used as follows:

(*f)(list_ptr->data);

You must use the following structure, and turn it in as a file called
ft_list.h:

typedef struct    s_list
{
    struct s_list *next;
    void          *data;
}                 t_list;

Assignment name  : checkmate
Expected files   : *.c, *.h
Allowed functions: write, malloc, free
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program who takes rows of a chessboard in argument and check if your
King is in a check position.

Chess is played on a chessboard, a squared board of 8-squares length with
specific pieces on it : King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook and Pawns.
For this exercice, you will only play with Pawns, Bishops, Rooks and Queen...
and obviously a King.

Each piece have a specific method of movement, and all patterns of capture are
detailled in the examples.txt file.

A piece can capture only the first ennemy piece it founds on its capture
patterns.

The board have a variable size but will remains a square. There's only one King
and all other pieces are against it. All other characters except those used for
pieces are considered as empty squares.

The King is considered as in a check position when an other enemy piece can
capture it. When it's the case, you will print "Success" on the standard output
followed by a newline, otherwise you will print "Fail" followed by a newline.

If there is no arguments, the program will only print a newline.

Examples:

$> ./chessmate '..' '.K' | cat -e
Fail$
$> ./chessmate 'R...' '..P.' '.K..' '....' | cat -e
Success$
$> ./chessmate 'R...' 'iheK' '....' 'jeiR' | cat -e
Success$
$> ./chessmate | cat -e
$

Assignment name  : ft_itoa
Expected files   : ft_itoa.c
Allowed functions: malloc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a function that takes an int and converts it to a null-terminated string.
The function returns the result in a char array that you must allocate.

Your function must be declared as follows:

char	*ft_itoa(int nbr);

Assignment name  : sort_list
Expected files   : sort_list.c
Allowed functions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write the following functions:

t_list	*sort_list(t_list* lst, int (*cmp)(int, int));

This function must sort the list given as a parameter, using the function
pointer cmp to select the order to apply, and returns a pointer to the
first element of the sorted list.

Duplications must remain.

Inputs will always be consistent.

You must use the type t_list described in the file list.h
that is provided to you. You must include that file
(#include "list.h"), but you must not turn it in. We will use our own
to compile your assignment.

Functions passed as cmp will always return a value different from
0 if a and b are in the right order, 0 otherwise.

For example, the following function used as cmp will sort the list
in ascending order:

int ascending(int a, int b)
{
	return (a <= b);
}

Assignment name  : sort_int_tab
Expected files   : sort_int_tab.c
Allowed functions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write the following function:

void sort_int_tab(int *tab, unsigned int size);

It must sort (in-place) the 'tab' int array, that contains exactly 'size'
members, in ascending order.

Doubles must be preserved.

Input is always coherent.

Assignment name  : ft_list_remove_if
Expected files   : ft_list_remove_if.c
Allowed functions: free
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a function called ft_list_remove_if that removes from the
passed list any element the data of which is "equal" to the reference data.

It will be declared as follows :

void ft_list_remove_if(t_list **begin_list, void *data_ref, int (*cmp)());

cmp takes two void* and returns 0 when both parameters are equal.

You have to use the ft_list.h file, which will contain:

$>cat ft_list.h
typedef struct      s_list
{
    struct s_list   *next;
    void            *data;
}                   t_list;
$>

Assignment name  : ft_itoa_base
Expected files   : ft_itoa_base.c
Allowed functions: malloc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a function that converts an integer value to a null-terminated string
using the specified base and stores the result in a char array that you must
allocate.

The base is expressed as an integer, from 2 to 16. The characters comprising
the base are the digits from 0 to 9, followed by uppercase letter from A to F.

For example, base 4 would be "0123" and base 16 "0123456789ABCDEF".

If base is 10 and value is negative, the resulting string is preceded with a
minus sign (-). With any other base, value is always considered unsigned.

Your function must be declared as follows:

char	*ft_itoa_base(int value, int base);

Assignment name  : flood_fill
Expected files   : *.c, *.h
Allowed functions: -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a function that takes a char ** as a 2-dimensional array of char, a
t_point as the dimensions of this array and a t_point as the starting point.

Starting from the given 'begin' t_point, this function 'colors' an entire zone
by replacing characters inside by the character 'F'. A zone is an ensemble of
the same character delimitated horizontally and vertically by other characters.

The flood_fill function won't 'color' in diagonal.

The flood_fill function will be prototyped like this:
  void  flood_fill(char **tab, t_point size, t_point begin);

The t_point structure is available inside the "t_point.h" file attached to this
assignment. We will use our "t_point.h" for graduation.

Example :

$> cat test_main.c
#include "test_functions.h"
#include "flood_fill.h"

int main(void)
{
	char **area;
	t_point size = { 8, 5 };
	t_point begin = { 2, 2 };
	char *zone[] = {
		"11111111",
		"10001001",
		"10010001",
		"10110001",
		"11100001"
	};

	area = make_area(zone);
	print_tab(area);
	flood_fill(area, size, begin);
	putc('\n');
	print_tab(area);
	return (0);
}
